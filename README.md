#Maya Driver

I'm a developer at consultancy firm Deloitte Digital. I'm currently working with Scala and would like to find a role using either Scala or Ruby, but I am also interested in working with any OO or Functional language.

##Experience

###Deloitte Digital
**Junior developer (February 2015)**

Since joining Deloitte, I have worked on several projects, including building a Meteor web-based survey for internal use, contributing to a large-scale ecommerce website built on a Java platform, working on both front-end and back-end tickets, and also doing back-end development for a Scala project.

###Thomson Reuters
**Web Portal Manager (May 2011 - December 2014)**

My role involved increasing traffic to the consumer-facing legal portal, FindLaw. My daily work required writing news blogs with a legal perspective and managing and resourcing external content writers. I controlled the content and design of the site and managed this both directly using various CMSs and also through liaising with external developers to build new projects and deal with ad-hoc bugs. I implemented SEO strategy in conjunction with the in-house expert. I then monitored the performance of the website and reported on traffic stats. My efforts grew the site's traffic from an average of 42k visits per month to 300k visits per month.

*Before joining TR, I travelled the world for several months.*

###AOL
**Search Editor (June 2008 - April 2010)**

###Yahoo!
**Search Editor (April 2007 - June 2008)**

*Prior to working in web editing roles, I worked as an editor in book publishing.*
