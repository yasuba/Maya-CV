=======

I'm a junior developer looking for my first role after completing an intensive 12-week coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. In addition to my newly acquired coding skills, I have extensive experience in web editing and management.

##Code examples

 [Fhellow](https://fhellow.herokuapp.com)| [Yelp on Rails](https://github.com/yasuba/yelp-rails)| [Twitter front-end](https://github.com/yasuba/twitter-frontend)  
 :------|:-----|:------
 Fhellow was my final project at Makers Academy. It is a social networking app for freelancers, built on Rails.| This was the first Rails project I built at Makers Academy. It is a restaurant review site similar to Yelp.| I was challenged to recreate the Twitter.com feed page, as close as possible to the real look and feel, in order to practice HTML and CSS.
