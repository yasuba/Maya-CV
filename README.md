#Maya Driver

I'm a junior developer looking for my first role after completing an intensive 12-week coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. In addition to my newly acquired coding skills, I have extensive experience in web editing and management.

##Code examples

 [Fhellow](https://fhellow.herokuapp.com)| [Yelp on Rails](https://github.com/yasuba/yelp-rails)| [Twitter front-end](https://github.com/yasuba/twitter-frontend)  
 :------|:-----|:------
 Fhellow was my final project at Makers Academy. It is a social networking app for freelancers, built on Rails.| This was the first Rails project I built at Makers Academy. It is a restaurant review site similar to Yelp.| I was challenged to recreate the Twitter.com feed page, as close as possible to the real look and feel, in order to practice HTML and CSS.

##Web development

I began to teach myself HTML and CSS when I was working in an editorial role for Yahoo! I later taught myself PHP while taking a part-time course in web design and development at Birkbeck University. I then joined Makers Academy in August where I have gained skills in:

* Headless testing frameworks: Zombie.js, Poltergeist
* Test-driven development and behaviour-driven development
* Pair programming
* Agile principles and practice
* Object-oriented principles and design

* Integration of APIs including Twilio and Google Maps

##Experience

###Thomson Reuters
**Web Portal Manager (Since May 2011)**

My role is in equal parts creative and technical. I create and manage projects to improve and increase traffic to the consumer-facing legal portal, FindLaw. My daily work requires writing news blogs with a legal perspective and managing and resourcing external content writers. I have control of the content and design of the site and manage this both directly using various CMSs and also through liaising with external developers to build new projects and deal with ad-hoc bugs. I implement SEO strategy in conjunction with the in-house expert. I then monitor the performance of the website and report on traffic stats.

*Before joining TR, I travelled the world for several months.*

###AOL
**Search Editor (June 2008 - April 2010)**

I wrote, edited, updated and managed content for the AOL Hot Searches UK blog, a traffic-generating channel which funnelled visitors to AOL Search. Through the blog, I increased unique visitors to AOL Search by more than one million. I managed external bloggers and maintained the editorial schedule for the Hot Searches Blogs across UK, France and Germany. In order to increase circulation across AOL properties I had to regularly liaise with other channel managers. I created content for Hot Searches marketing campaigns, targeted at increasing UVs and engaging users.

###Yahoo!
**Search Editor (April 2007 - June 2008)**

My teamâ€™s efforts improved the relevance of the Yahoo! search index significantly, increasing it from being far behind the leading competition to beating them by a score of 5%. In recognition of our achievement, my team was nominated for Team of the Quarter. My work involved training new team members, carrying out editorial testing of search results for relevance. I regularly detected and removed spam from search results and created editorial guidelines and wrote copy and blogs.

*Prior to working in web editing roles, I worked as an editor in book publishing.*
