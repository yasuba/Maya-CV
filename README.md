##Experience

###Deloitte Digital
**Junior developer (February 2015)**

Building stuff in Scala

###Thomson Reuters
**Web Portal Manager (May 2011 - December 2014)**

My role is partly creative and partly technical. I create and manage projects to improve and increase traffic to the consumer-facing legal portal, FindLaw. My daily work requires writing news blogs with a legal perspective and managing and resourcing external content writers. I have control of the content and design of the site and manage this both directly using various CMSs and also through liaising with external developers to build new projects and deal with ad-hoc bugs. I implement SEO strategy in conjunction with the in-house expert. I then monitor the performance of the website and report on traffic stats. Since joining the company, my efforts have grown the site's traffic from an average of 42k visits per month to 300k visits per month.

*Before joining TR, I travelled the world for several months.*

###AOL
**Search Editor (June 2008 - April 2010)**

I wrote, edited, updated and managed content for the AOL Hot Searches UK blog, a traffic-generating channel which funnelled visitors to AOL Search. Through the blog, I increased unique visitors to AOL Search by more than one million. I managed external bloggers and maintained the editorial schedule for the Hot Searches Blogs across UK, France and Germany. In order to increase circulation across AOL properties I had to regularly liaise with other channel managers. I created content for Hot Searches marketing campaigns, targeted at increasing UVs and engaging users.

###Yahoo!
**Search Editor (April 2007 - June 2008)**

My teamâ€™s efforts improved the relevance of the Yahoo! search index significantly, increasing it from being far behind the leading competition to beating them by a score of 5%. In recognition of our achievement, my team was nominated for Team of the Quarter. My work involved training new team members, carrying out editorial testing of search results for relevance. I regularly detected and removed spam from search results and created editorial guidelines and wrote copy and blogs.

*Prior to working in web editing roles, I worked as an editor in book publishing.*

##Education
